## About the Lab
According to the lab manual, you are supposed to work on a function of x. But as per the lab instructions, we are working on a 2D Matrix (aka Landscape).

I have written codes for both the cases. You can find the code for the function of x in the [L3_1.py](./L3_1.py) file and the code for the 2D Matrix in the [L3_2.py](./L3_2.py) file.

Based on the instructions in lab, use the code as required
